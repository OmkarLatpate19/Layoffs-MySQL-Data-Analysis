# Layoffs-MySQL-Data-Analysis

This is personal project to apply my analytics skills using MySQL. In this project I have analysed the Layoffs data from 2020 to 2023 of various industries across the world.

I have done following things :
▪ Conducted exploratory data analysis to identify key trends and patterns in layoffs. 
▪ Analysed maximum layoffs and percentages, companies with 100% layoffs, and companies with 
the highest total layoffs. 
▪ Grouped data by company, industry, country, and date to understand layoffs distribution and 
trends over time. 
▪ Calculated rolling totals and identified top 5 companies with highest layoffs each year.
